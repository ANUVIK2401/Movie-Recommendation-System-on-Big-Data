# Recommender System with CURE Clustering

## Introduction
In today's digital age, recommender systems play a vital role in leveraging the vast amounts of user data available in private databases. However, handling this immense data has become challenging due to the proliferation of user-generated content on the web. Traditional recommender systems rely on algorithms like K-means and collaborative filtering, but they struggle to handle large datasets where content is not readily available. 

## Approach
To address this challenge, we propose the use of the CURE algorithm for clustering the data. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms that are biased towards spherical-shaped clusters with similar sizes, CURE offers a more flexible approach. It can handle outliers and suggest clusters of non-spherical shapes with varying sizes, making it suitable for heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, CURE employs a combination of partitioning and random sampling to efficiently manage voluminous databases.

## Objectives
1. **Enhanced Clustering:** Implement CURE algorithm to cluster data effectively, accommodating non-spherical clusters and varying sizes.
2. **Scalability:** Enable scalability by managing large volumes of data efficiently using partitioning and random sampling techniques.
3. **Improved Recommendation:** Enhance recommendation accuracy by leveraging CURE-clustering to analyze user behavior and preferences.

## Methodology
We will implement the CURE algorithm to cluster the dataset, which includes user preferences and interactions. By clustering users with similar preferences, we aim to improve recommendation accuracy. Additionally, we will explore techniques to parallelize the clustering process to handle big datasets more efficiently.

## Conclusion
This project aims to revolutionize recommender systems by leveraging the power of CURE clustering to handle large and heterogeneous datasets. By implementing a more flexible clustering approach, we anticipate improved recommendation accuracy and scalability, ultimately enhancing the user experience in the digital age.
